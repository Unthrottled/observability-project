I want this to be like a blog with numbers talking about specific data points.

Statistics:

- Total Hours Recorded:
  - Break down of things that matter most (Like the pie chart)
    - How long did I code?
    - How long did I workout?
    - How long did I Spend doing other things I didn't care about (excluding anime fridays.)
    - Family Time?
    - Creative Work?


- Average time to work (to first activity)?
- Average time of valuable work done outside of career?
- What did an average week for me look like?
- Pro Social Distancer?
